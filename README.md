#YouTube Bulk Subscribe
Run this JS script through the Console to bulk delete channel subscriptions

This script is a modified version of an original script found here: https://www.alphr.com/mass-unsubscribe-youtube/

Sadly, UI changes at YouTube renders the original script useless. 

This script simply modifies the code to identify the "confirmation" button to compelte the unsubscribe activity.

***Note*** this is will unsubscribe you from all of the channels you are following. This is a blowtorch, not a scalpel.

## Instructions

1. Visit your Subscriptions area in YouTube
2. Click "Manage" from the top right corner
3. Once the page has loaded, it's best to scroll all the way to the bottom of your subscriptions to ensure you unsubscribe to as many channels as possible
4. Right-click in a empty area of the page to bring up the context menu and then choose "inspect"
5. Open your "console" tab and paste the code at the bottom
6. Press "Enter" on your keyboard and allow the script to run
7. You should see a verification pop up in the bottom left of the screen with each successful unsubsribe action
8. To view the results, just refresh the page
